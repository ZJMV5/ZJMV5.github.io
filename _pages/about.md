I received the M.Eng. degree in signal and information processing from the [Institute of Acoustics, CAS](https://ioa.cas.cn/) and [University of Chinese Academy of Sciences](https://www.ucas.ac.cn/), Beijing, China, in 2025, where I was very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Chaohuan Hou](https://people.ucas.ac.cn/~0000449)(Academician of CAS, IEEE Life Fellow) and [Prof. Chengpeng Hao](https://people.ucas.ac.cn/~0036112). Before that, I received the B.Eng. in electronic sciences and technology in 2022 from [Hohai University](https://www.hhu.edu.cn/), Nanjing, China. My research interests include array signal processing and sparse signal processing, with particular emphasis on wideband array signal processing algorithms based on compressed sensing and their efficient implementation.
