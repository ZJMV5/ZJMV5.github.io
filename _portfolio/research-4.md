When the region of the DOA is known, the algorithm complexity can be reduced by searching for DOAs only
within a constrained area. To achieve gridless DOA estimation and make full use of the prior information
about the DOA region, an area-constrained DOA estimation algorithm based on atomic norm minimization was
proposed. Furthermore, a fast implementation algorithm based on the primal-dual interior-point method
was developed. Theoretical analysis and numerical simulations demonstrated the superiority of the proposed
algorithms.
