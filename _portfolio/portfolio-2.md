In order to achieve two-dimensional localization with wideband sonar, the joint angle-range estimation for
wideband LFM pulse sonar was studied. Based on the atomic norm minimization theory, gridless joint
angle-range estimation algorithms were proposed for both single-pulse and multi-pulse scenarios. Simulation
results showed that the proposed gridless algorithms can effectively suppress the impact of aliasing. Furthermore, since they are not affected by grid mismatch, they outperform the grid-based algorithms at high SNRs.
The proposed multi-pulse algorithm successfully eliminates the influence of range migration, achieves coherent accumulation across multiple pulses, and performs better than the single-pulse algorithm, especially
at low SNRs.
