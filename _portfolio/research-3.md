In order to distinguish between targets, reverberation, and interference, the problem of joint angle-velocity estimation for wideband LFM pulse sonars was studied. Grid-based and gridless joint angle-velocity estimation methods were proposed based on the multi-dictionary SBL method and atomic norm minimization
method, respectively. Furthermore, by introducing the special structure brought about by range information, an ANM method that considers range information was proposed. Simulation results show that compared
to traditional algorithms, the proposed algorithms can all suppress the effects of angle aliasing and velocity
ambiguity. Since they are not affected by grid mismatch, both gridless methods outperform the grid-based
method when the SNR is sufficiently high. In particular, due to the utilization of the structure provided by range
information, the ANM method that considers range information demonstrates better robustness and accuracy
than the ANM method that ignores range information.

Part of this work (i.e. the grid-based method) has been published in the [conference paper](https://zjmv5.github.io/publication/MDSBL) (in Chinese). The gridless methods were presented in my Master's thesis.
