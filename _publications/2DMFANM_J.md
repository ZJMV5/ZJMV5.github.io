To achieve gridless joint elevation-azimuth angle estimation of wideband signals, an algorithm based on atomic norm minimization theory is proposed. To reduce computational complexity, two fast implementation algorithms based on decoupling and eliminating redundant information are proposed. Theoretical analysis and numerical simulations demonstrate the superiority of the proposed algorithms.
