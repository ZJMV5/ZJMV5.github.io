To address the challenge that classical narrowband signal processing algorithms cannot be directly applied to wideband signals, an angle-velocity joint estimation algorithm suitable for wideband FMCW sonar is proposed. Addressing issues such as fast time and slow time coupling and frequency-dependent spatial steering vectors inherent in wideband signals, the proposed algorithm constructs a multi-dictionary sparse recovery problem to achieve joint angle-velocity estimation under these conditions while also mitigating the impact of 
velocity ambiguity. To accelerate the solution process, the proposed algorithm employs a multi-dictionary SBL algorithm to solve the sparse recovery problem. Numerical simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can achieve high-resolution and accurate angle-velocity estimation under conditions of fast time and slow time coupling, frequency-varying spatial steering vectors, and velocity ambiguity.
