When the region of the DOA is known, the algorithm complexity can be reduced by searching for DOAs only within a constrained area. To achieve gridless DOA estimation and make full use of the prior information about the DOA region, an area-constrained DOA estimation algorithm based on atomic norm minimization was proposed. Furthermore, a fast implementation algorithm based on the primal-dual interior-point method was developed. Theoretical analysis and numerical simulations demonstrated the superiority of the proposed algorithms.
